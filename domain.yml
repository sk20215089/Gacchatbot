  utter_balance:
  - text: "The aim of this project is to make an automated vehicle that balances itself without any outside help or support.This project is a rather complex one as it involves using PID Control and involuted programming. Self-balancing robots are unique among all others, just because of their ability to balance on a given fixed position. Even if the robot is displaced from its position, it is programmed so that it again recovers its position.
            \nTechnology used:\n
            On Robot: Bluetooth, PID, TIMER Interrupt, Kalman Filter, Communication protocol (serial and I2C).\n
            Features:\n
            1.The robot balances on two wheels.\n
            2.We can move the robot left, right, forward, and backward.\n
            3.Option to set the PID constants from the onboard knob as well as wirelessly from the Android application.\n
            4.The robot stands on its own with a servo motor for calibration when powered on.\n
            5.We can reset the robot wirelessly in case it falls on the ground.\n
            6.Used PORT control of Arduino for making the pin high and low as it is 60 times faster than the digitalWrite function of Arduino."
